Today my goal is to learn to program at the proper level (which will be enough for employment). It would be ideal to find a remote job, but I understand that with a minimal set of knowledge it is very difficult.
I have no programming experience as such, but I have 15 years of experience in the construction industry. I started as an assistant to a cable installer, then after receiving my education I worked as an economist, then as a senior economist (in fact, an engineer in the production department), and for the last 3-4 years I was the head of the production department. Therefore, I think that as a junior, I can quickly stop being a burden for the team and start to be useful
